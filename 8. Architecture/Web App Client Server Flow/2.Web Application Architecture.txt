# Web App Architecture:
    - client fill form
    - send data to server
    - send/requested data into server where data process is done by web-server-framework (over server-side)
    - some of web-server-framework: node.js + ExpressJs, python + Django, python + Flask, php + Laravel, php + Drupel. etc
    - express.js is a framework above node.js, that provides library to node in oder to exchange of data from client and server.

# Some of concept of Web App Client and Server Architecture:
    - request: data send from client to server is called as request.
    - response: data send from server to client after process to corresponding request is called as response.

# To request one single file there might be many request send to server and respective response.

# Web Server Port;

# express server:
    - url: hamrofutsal.com/home
    - url: server_domain + endpoint_path ==> hamrofutsal.com + /home =>  hamrofutsal.com/home

# End point vs API vs URL:
    - url to webapp.
    - url to api.
    - api endpoint or url endpoint
