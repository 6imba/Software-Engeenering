- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of the users that request access to a system, network, or device.
- Authoriztion in other hand is the process of verifying permissions of particular authenticated user.

- Authentication: verifying the identity
- Authoriztion: verifying permissions

- Authentication and Authorization determines HTTP response status code.
    - Authentication(401 Unauthorized)
    - Authorization(403 Forbidden)

# Authentication:
    - Example:
        * Entering a username and password when you log in to a website.
        * Finger print to unlock modile.

    - There exist main 3 process|method of Authentication.
        1. Password-based authentication. (most common methods) ==> something you know
        2. Token-based authentication. (such as bank card, jwt) ==> something you have
        3. Biometric authentication. (such as fingerprints, voice recognition) ==> something you are
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Authorization (authZ) is the next step after authentication.
- You cannot be authorized to perform a function, have privileges assigned, or perform tasks in a given role, without first being authenticated.
- Authorization = privileges (what you are allowed to do) + Authentication
- Authorization can be defined as the right to perform a function based on your authentication.

# Authoriztion:
    - Common Authorization Methods:
        - Role-based access controls (RBAC)
        - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

# While authentication and authorization are often used interchangeably, they are separate processes used to protect an organization from cyber-attacks. As data breaches continue to escalate in both frequency and scope, authentication and authorization are the first line of defense to prevent confidential data from falling into the wrong hands. As a result, strong authentication and authorization methods should be a critical part of every organizationâ€™s overall security strategy.

Q. Authentication vs. Authorization
    - So, what is the difference between authentication and authorization? Simply put, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the proces

# A Strong Authentication & Authorization Strategy Is Essential.
