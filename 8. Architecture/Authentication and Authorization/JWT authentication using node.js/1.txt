# 1st part: JWT authentication:
    - create token in server-side,
    - send token to client-side,
    - authenticate those token on server-side on every http request.

# 2nd part: Use Refresh token:
    - automatically refresh our jwt tokens(to increase the security of our server)
    - revoke the priviliages from user, that no longer want to access the server( similar to how logout function works)

# npm i express nodemon jsonwentoken dotenv
