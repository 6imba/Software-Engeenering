1. Data| Database | DataCenter
2. Server(it can be a program, software, dedicated_software, a_specialized_hardware for special purspose)
3. Variety of server with respective purpose: Storage_Server, Database_Server, File_Server, Communicaton_Server, Application_Server, Local Server vs Delicated Server, Web hosting server etc
4. Designat ing a computer as "server-class hardware" implies that it is specialized for running servers on it.
5. Server maintain, host, handles and serve the resources(data) stored some kinf of storage_system(Database |DataCenter| LocalComputer) to all around the request on network.
6. Specialized hardware on which a special_program(os,software) is run, and later that harware serves the resources around network on request.
7. Server is the dedicated_main_computer on a network that fulfills/response the request of other computers over a same network.

8. Services of Servers:(Storages, Backup, Security)

9. Types of server acoording to services it provides: 
(
File_Server(ftp protocel), 
Application_Server,
Mail_Server(stmp protocel),
Web_Hosting_Server(http protocel), host websites
Database_Server(backend&frontend using queries),
DNS server,
)

10. Client(request) <--> Server(response)

11. Disadvantages of server: 
(
* if server fails all network(other_computer_linked_with_server will also fail),
* expensive,
)


11. Server: Powerfull Dediacted Computer, Main Computer on a network, Dedicated Software, Program, Work Stations, Centralized Machine, Centralized Computer.

12. Server is a centralized machine where multiple clients over the internet or in a LAN gets connected for special services.

13. Big Organization: (Different server for different services. because many request needed to be handled)
14. Small Organization: (Single server for  different services. because few are request needed to be handled)

15. Server is not just a physical computer. A server is actually a role that a computer takes, because any ordinary desktop_computer,device,hardware can be set up as a server and its not compulsary to be powerful.
e.g: you can setup a network in your home and ser your laptop,desktop,mobile as a server(file_server, web_server) with proper software and share files, hosted_website to the compters connected to your setted_computer_network. But as our laptop and desktop is not design for server putposese so it might not function well when request from client computer exceeds its limit.

16. Client and Server both are a piece of computer hardware or software, where client request for resources and server response to the request of a client.
    Server is a computer that provides services.
    Client gets connected to server either wired or wirelessly.

17. Processor for desktop: Intel core i7,
18. Processor for server: Intel XEON, (ECC RAM), higher cache memory, higer core count, 


19.  Hardware Component of a server: Processor(CPU), Main_Memory(RAM), Internal_Storage(HardDrive), Network Interface Controller(NIC), Peripheral_Devices.
     High load to a server(more request) leads to server down.

20.  Server Can host different Operating System: LINUX, Microsoft Window Server, MacOS server, FreeBSD, Android.

21. Many server of goggle in many places.

22. CISCO offers two types of servers: CISCO UCS-C Series & CISCO UCS-B Series.

23. Browser_Request -> Internet -> Server -> Data_Center (<-Response)
