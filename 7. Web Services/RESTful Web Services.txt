- RESTful Web Services are basically REST Architecture based Web Services.
- In REST Architecture everything is a resource.
- RESTful web services are light weight, highly scalable and maintainable and are very commonly used to create APIs for web-based applications. 
- Basic components of RESTful Web Services.
- REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
- REST is web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol.
- It revolves around resource where every component is a resource and a resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods.
- In REST architecture, a REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and modifies the resources.
- Here each resource is identified by URIs/ global IDs.
- REST uses various representation to represent a resource like text, JSON, XML. JSON is the most popular one.
- HTTP methods commonly used in REST based architecture:
	GET − Provides a read only access to a resource.
	POST − Used to create a new resource.
	DELETE − Used to remove a resource.
	PUT − Used to update a existing resource or create a new resource.
- A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems.
- Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet in a manner similar to inter-process communication on a single computer.
- This interoperability (e.g., between Java and Python, or Windows and Linux applications) is due to the use of open standards.
- Web services based on REST Architecture are known as RESTful web services.
- These webservices uses HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture.
- A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation such as JSON and set of HTTP Methods.
