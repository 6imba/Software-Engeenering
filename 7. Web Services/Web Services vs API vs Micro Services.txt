- World Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet.
- Services delivered over the web is called web services.
- There are two types of web services: SOAP Web Services. REST Web Services.
- Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
- All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.

- There is more than one way to answer, “What is a web service?” But, essentially, web services include any software, application, or cloud technology that provides standardized web protocols (HTTP or HTTPS) to interoperate, communicate, and exchange data messaging – usually XML (Extensible Markup Language) – throughout the internet.
- There are a few central types of web services: XML-RPC, UDDI, SOAP, and REST:
- Web service is a standardized medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the WWW (World Wide Web). 
- Server hosting web service.
- Web service: interaction between client application and web server.

- API is used to make communication between two system.
- Weather API, Payment Gateway, Air Flight API, Login with API, SMS API, Hotel Booking, so on.
- Free API(Just hit end point) & Purchase API(Authentoicated & Authorized secrect-key) & Web Services (Authentication Credential)

- A_system needs data of B_system.
- Here, A_system directly doesnt inreact with database of B_system.
- Therefore, B_system has API with created so that Thrid party can interract with certain data in their database.
- So, A_system inreact with API of B_system , and then B_system_API interract with its databse.
- Access API via endpoint(url).
- Other system can access our API via endpoint(url) with unique_security-key provided to them, if API is not free.
- API is utility developed by system for other system to interact with its database.
- Every API has documentation.

- Web Services makes interaction between two system.
    - If you need service over the web using HTTP protocol, we mostly use Web Services.
- API makes interaction between two system.
    - If you want to make third party utility/dependency integration, you use API.
- All Web Service are API but all API are not Web Service.
- REST API is just one of the type of API. (other SOAP API)
- SOAP API (XML)
- REST API (Plain Text, JSON, HTML, so on)
- REST: Representational State Transfer
* API endpoint --> Authentication --> Authorization.

- Is all service delivered over a network via HTTP Web Service? ==> No

- Mricro Service:
    - Solution to Monolithic Architecture.
    - Break down large system into diferent small n number of component(microservices/module) and configure them.
    - Dynamic scaling
    - 

- WebApp vs WebService vs API vs MicroSerivce.

- Type of Web Service:
    - SOAP
    - REST
