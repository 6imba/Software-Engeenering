#1. SDLC: SDLC is the process or a specific set of procedures, steps, and documents that carry a project through its technical development.
    - SDLC is a methodology used to develop, maintain, and replace information systems.
    - SDLC defines the software development process.
    - SDLC is used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software.
    - SDLC aims to produce the quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within time and budget.
    - Software Development Process.

#2. Phases/Stages of Software Development Life Cycle are:
    Phase 1: Feasibility study(SRS/Pricing)         ==> “What are the current problems?”
    Phase 2: Requirement collection and analysis    ==> “What do we want?”
    Phase 3: Design(DFD/UIUX/ERD/Database)          ==> “How will we get what we want?”
    Phase 4: Coding(Implementation/Building)        ==> “Let’s create what we want.”
    Phase 5: Testing(Unit/Integration/etcTesting)   ==> “Did we get what we want?”
    Phase 6: Installation/Deployment                ==> “Let’s start using what we got.”
    Phase 7: Maintenance(Technical-Support)         ==> “Let’s get this closer to what we want.”

#3. SDLC-Methodology || System-Development-Model:
    - Some of the most important models/methodology for the conceptual implementation of SDLC:
        1. Waterfall Model
        2. Agile Model
        3. Prototype Model
        4. Iterative Model
        5. Spiral Model
        6. V-Shaped Model
        7. Big Bang Model
        8. RAD
        9. RAD and PM
        10. Incremental Model
        11. Evaluationary Model

#4. SDLC-Methodology || System-Development-Model && their framework:
    - Software-Development-Model ==> Framework
        1. Agile Model           ==> Scrum, Kanban, XP
